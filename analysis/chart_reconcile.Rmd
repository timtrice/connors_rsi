Details
The theoretical trades, positions, and P&L are plotted first, in the 'light' versions of the colors, and then the actual values are overplotted in the main color. If they agree completely, the theoretical values will not be visible. Differences will make themselves visible by misalignment of the symbols or lines.

The fourth panel is the difference in P&L between the theoretical and actual values, and could be considered 'slippage', which could be positive or negative. It is calculated by subtracting the theoretical P&L from the actual P&L. If parameter PLdiff is 'cumulative', then this panel will display the cumsum of difference between the theoretical and actual portfolios. If parameter PLdiff is 'episodic' it will display the differences in P&L

The data parameter allows the user to either View or return the data calculated inside the chart. Default FALSE (only chart)

```{r chart-reconcile}
src <- map(
  .x = sort(symbols), 
  .f = function(x) {
    knitr::knit_expand(
      file = here::here("./analysis/child/child_chart_reconcile.Rmd"), 
      symbol = x
    )
  }
)
```

`r knitr::knit(text = unlist(src))`
